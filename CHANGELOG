### SEMANTIC VERSION: Example: v1.2.3-alpha/beta
- 1 - Major version and may result to incompatibilities from previous major release.
- 2 - Minor version is when you add functionaly on the project. When you increase this, reset patch version.
- 3 - Patch version, meaning this is used mainly on change and fixing.
- alpha - An alpha release usually means a website or application is working but some functionality is likely to be missing and a number of known and unknown bugs are likely to surface.
- beta -  A pre-release of software that is given out to a large group of users to try under real conditions. Beta versions have gone through alpha testing inhouse and are generally fairly close in look, feel and function to the final product; however, design changes often occur as a result.
